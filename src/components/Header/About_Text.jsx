export default "Hello, I'm Amit & welcome to my portfolio. I've been a developer for the past few years. I've been involved with technology my whole life. With hardware, I've assembled my own computers, fiddled with different components and have performed my own repairs on devices for myself and others. Starting in Feb. 2020, I've ventured down the path to understand the coding side of technology, attending a coding bootcamp(Eleven Fifty Academy) to learn Javascript, and the modern practices of Web Development. \n After 6 months of intensive learning, I graduated from the bootcamp, quickly understanding the fundamentals during the early stages. Due to my performance during the course, I was offered to become a learning assistant for Javascript and Web development from the academy. As a learning assistant, my role covered debugging/teaching the new students enrolled in the same WebDev course that I graduated from. 6 months after that, I was offered to being a instructor trainee. To where I taught new students through live coding lessons, helping them a bit further to understand the core concepts, along with debugging, and guiding them towards success throughout the course. \n Since taking on that role, I still continue to learn, polishing off my skills, and demonstrating what I have learned along the way. Having a keen eye for detail, I've always favored work with UI/UX, although I am fully experienced with both frontend and backend frameworks, having the ability to develop full stack applications."
